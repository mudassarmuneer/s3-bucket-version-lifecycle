# Configure S3 Bucket with Version & Lifecycle Policies

In a recent project, I successfully configured an S3 bucket with versioning and life-cycle policies to provide enhanced security and cost-effectiveness. The following steps were taken during the implementation:

## Project Overview

The project involved configuring an S3 bucket with versioning and life-cycle policies to enhance security and optimize costs. Key configurations included:

- **SSE AES-256 Encryption:** Configured the S3 bucket with SSE AES-256 encryption to ensure data remained private.

- **Object Encryption:** Configured the bucket object to encrypt while being PUT and decrypt while being GET.

- **Object-Level Versioning:** Enabled object-level versioning and created at least two objects with three versions. Version 1 exists on S3 standard, version 2 on Standard-IA, and version 3 on RRS.

- **Life-cycle Policy:** Configured a life-cycle policy for the S3 bucket to automatically move standard objects to S3-IA after 10 days and to Glacier after 30 days.

## Benefits

The configuration provided the following benefits:

- **Data Security:** Ensured data was encrypted at rest and in transit, enhancing overall data security.

- **Versioning Protection:** Object-level versioning added an extra layer of protection against accidental deletions and data loss.

- **Cost Optimization:** Life-cycle policy facilitated a cost-effective storage strategy by moving older objects to lower-cost storage tiers as they aged.

## Technology Stack

- **AWS Services:**
  - Amazon S3
  - Server-Side Encryption (SSE)
  - S3 Object Versioning
  - S3 Lifecycle Policies

## Deployment Process

The deployment process focused on configuring and implementing versioning and life-cycle policies to enhance data security and optimize storage costs.

## Conclusion

This configuration was effective in meeting the client's requirements for enhanced data security and cost optimization. Leveraging encryption, versioning, and life-cycle policies, the S3 bucket provided a secure and cost-effective solution for storing and managing data.
